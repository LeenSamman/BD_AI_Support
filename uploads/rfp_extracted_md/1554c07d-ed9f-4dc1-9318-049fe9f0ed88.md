## 2. Technical Proposal

The technical proposal shall comprise the parts below. Please note that the proposal must be responsive to the detailed information set out in Section II of this RFP, which provides the background, states the scope of work, describes the deliverables, and provides a deliverables schedule.

-  Part 1: Technical Approach, Methodology and Detailed Work Plan. This part shall be between 3 and 5 pages long but may not exceed 7 pages.
-  Part 2: Management, Personnel, and Staffing Plan. This part shall be between 3 and 5 pages long but may not exceed 7 pages. CVs for personnel may be included in an annex to the technical proposal and will not count against the page limit.

The Research Expert should have the following qualifications:

-  Minimum  of  7  years  of  professional  experience  in  economic  development,  private  sector engagement, research, or donor-funded program implementation

## 3. Cost Proposal

The cost proposal is used to determine which proposals represent the best value and serves as a basis of negotiation before award of a subcontract.

The price of the subcontract to be awarded will be an all-inclusive fixed price. Nevertheless, for the purpose of  the  proposal,  offerors  must  provide  a  detailed  budget  showing  major  line  items  as  well  as  a  budget narrative. Please refer to Annex 2 for detailed instructions and a sample cost structure.

No profit, fees, taxes, or additional costs may be added after award. Because ERA is a USG funded project and  is  implemented  under  a  bilateral  agreement  between  the  Jordanian  Government  and  the  U.S. Government,  offerors  must  not  include  VAT  and  customs  duties  in  their  cost  proposal.  The  USG  has provided an exemption letter to this effect, a copy of which will be provided to the successful offeror upon award.

## I.8 Evaluation and Basis for Award

This RFP will use the tradeoff process to determine best value as set forth in FAR 15.101-1. That means that each proposal will be evaluated and scored against the evaluation criteria and evaluation sub-criteria, which are stated in the table below. Chemonics will award a subcontract to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to Chemonics and ERA. Chemonics may award to a higher priced offeror if a determination is made that the higher technical evaluation of that offeror merits the additional cost/price.

Evaluation points will not be awarded for cost, but for overall evaluation purposes of this RFP, technical evaluation factors other than cost, when combined, are considered approximately equal to cost factors. Cost will primarily be evaluated for realism and reasonableness. If technical scores are determined to be nearly equal, cost will become the determining factor.

In evaluating proposals, Chemonics will use the following evaluation criteria and sub-criteria:

| Evaluation Criteria                                      | Evaluation Sub-criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Maximum Points   |

## Section II Background, Scope of Work, Deliverables, and Deliverables Schedule

## II.1. Background

The Jordan Economic Reform Activity Task Order 1 (ERA TO1) is a 5-year, $54 million program funded by the United States Government, which aims to support the Government of Jordan (GOJ) to prioritize and implement economic reforms. Through coordination with the GOJ, the Jordanian and international private sector,  other  donors,  and  Jordanian  civil  society,  ERA  TO  1  will  (1)  advance  economic  reforms,  (2) strengthen the business enabling environment, (3) increase exports and local, regional, and international investments, and (4) respond to emerging priorities.

The overall objective of ERA is to accelerate Jordan's sustainable growth, led by increased exports and investment and through a strong, stable business enabling environment by strengthening the capacity of the Government of Jordan (GoJ), targeted institutions, competitiveness of anchor firms and the private sector.

## II.2. Scope of Work

ERA provided tailored technical assistance to Anabtawi Sweets Company by supporting the customization and full deployment  of the Odoo Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system across multiple  modules, including sales, inventory, manufacturing, e-commerce, and accounting. This support was designed to align with the company's growth vision and operational needs. As a result, Anabtawi enhanced its data tracking, decision-making, and process efficiency which resulted in reducing production waste, improving client and cash flow management, enabling a new digital sales channel, and achieving better overall performance.

A detailed case study is required to document this intervention and communicate the success and lessons learned from this collaboration. The case study will serve the following purposes:

1. Knowledge Capture and Documentation: Provide a comprehensive, structured documentation of the ERP  technical assistance process, detailing the phases of system customization, implementation, training, and data migration. Clearly outline what support was provided, how it was  executed,  and  the  resulting  improvements  in  Anabtawi  Sweets'  operational  processes  and digital infrastructure.
2. Performance and Outcome Analysis: Rigorously analyze both qualitative and quantitative data reflecting  the  company's  performance  before  and  after  ERP  implementation.  This  includes identifying measurable  changes  in  production  efficiency,  order  fulfillment  time,  inventory accuracy, reporting capabilities, and staff adoption of digital systems.
3. Communications and Visibility: Gather content that will be utilized for a dynamic and accessible communications  product  (factsheet/booklet)  that  narrates  the  digital  transformation  journey  of Anabtawi Sweets, visualizes key performance improvements, and clearly communicates ERA's role  and  value  in  enhancing operational agility, internal coordination, and data-driven  decisionmaking.

-  Conduct site  visits to  observe the ERP system in use across departments, including  data entry, procurement planning, production scheduling, inventory management, sales order processing, and distribution logistics
-  Gather  and  verify  all  relevant  performance  indicators  from  Odoo  reports,  company  logs,  and department-level data, with a specific focus on metrics that reflect improvements in value chain coordination,  such  as  reduced  lead  times,  improved  inventory  turnover,  and  enhanced  supplier management
-  With guidance from the anchor firms team, collect data to  feed  into  ERA's  impact  framework analysis. Please see Annex A for reference.
-  Triangulate data across sources to ensure accuracy, consistency, and representativeness of firmlevel outcomes and value chain enhancements.
-  Coordinate with ERA's communication team to join sites visits and interviews as appropriate to capture photographic and  video  footage  for use in the communications product and  other ERA communication materials.

## Types of Data to Be Collected:

Qualitative Data:

-  Direct testimonials and  quotes  capturing  leadership  reflections, operational impact, and  staff experiences with ERP adoption and the impact it has had on the firm's development and growth at varying levels.
-  Narratives detailing how the company adapted to the digital system and improved efficiency
-  Observations on employee buy-in, change management, and procedural enhancements

-  Evidence-based performance improvements : Before-and-after analysis of specific metrics such as processing time, inventory accuracy, and staff system adoption
-  Direct  and  indirect  impacts :  E.g.,  increased  operational  visibility,  enhanced  staff  capacity, improved coordination, and readiness for future digital expansion
-  Lessons learned and recommendations : Actionable insights for similar firms considering ERP adoption or digital transformation in the food manufacturing sector
-  Include:
-  Illustrative tables and charts demonstrating changes in key indicators
-  Key  results  and  visualized  metrics (e.g.,  reductions  in  processing  time,  increase  in  data accuracy)
-  Quotes from company leadership and staff highlighting perceived benefits and challenges
-  Timelines and snapshot infographics illustrating the phases of implementation and milestones achieved
-  Summary of ERA's contribution and value-added in enhancing Anabtawi's operational agility and competitiveness
