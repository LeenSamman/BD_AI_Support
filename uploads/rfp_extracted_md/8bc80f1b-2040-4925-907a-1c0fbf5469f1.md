## 1 ABOUT CARE

At CARE, we seek a world of hope, inclusion, and social justice, where poverty has been overcome and people live with dignity and security.

This has been our vision since 1945, when we were founded to send lifesaving CARE Packages® to survivors of World War II. Today, CARE is a leader in the global movement to end poverty. We put women and girls in the center because we know we cannot overcome poverty until all people have equal rights and opportunities. In 2019, CARE worked in 100 countries and reached 70 million people with an incredible range of life-saving programs.
