## 2. Technical Proposal

The technical proposal shall comprise the parts below. Please note that the proposal must be responsive to the detailed information set out in Section II of this RFP, which provides the background, states the scope of work, describes the deliverables, and provides a deliverables schedule.

The Research Expert should have the following qualifications:

## 3. Cost Proposal

The cost proposal is used to determine which proposals represent the best value and serves as a basis of negotiation before award of a subcontract.

The price of the subcontract to be awarded will be an all-inclusive fixed price. Nevertheless, for the purpose of  the  proposal,  offerors  must  provide  a  detailed  budget  showing  major  line  items  as  well  as  a  budget narrative. Please refer to Annex 2 for detailed instructions and a sample cost structure.

No profit, fees, taxes, or additional costs may be added after award. Because ERA is a USG funded project and  is  implemented  under  a  bilateral  agreement  between  the  Jordanian  Government  and  the  U.S. Government,  offerors  must  not  include  VAT  and  customs  duties  in  their  cost  proposal.  The  USG  has provided an exemption letter to this effect, a copy of which will be provided to the successful offeror upon award.

## I.8 Evaluation and Basis for Award

This RFP will use the tradeoff process to determine best value as set forth in FAR 15.101-1. That means that each proposal will be evaluated and scored against the evaluation criteria and evaluation sub-criteria, which are stated in the table below. Chemonics will award a subcontract to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to Chemonics and ERA. Chemonics may award to a higher priced offeror if a determination is made that the higher technical evaluation of that offeror merits the additional cost/price.

Evaluation points will not be awarded for cost, but for overall evaluation purposes of this RFP, technical evaluation factors other than cost, when combined, are considered approximately equal to cost factors. Cost will primarily be evaluated for realism and reasonableness. If technical scores are determined to be nearly equal, cost will become the determining factor.

In evaluating proposals, Chemonics will use the following evaluation criteria and sub-criteria:

| Evaluation Criteria                                      | Evaluation Sub-criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Maximum Points   |

## Section II Background, Scope of Work, Deliverables, and Deliverables Schedule

## II.1. Background

The Jordan Economic Reform Activity Task Order 1 (ERA TO1) is a 5-year, $54 million program funded by the United States Government, which aims to support the Government of Jordan (GOJ) to prioritize and implement economic reforms. Through coordination with the GOJ, the Jordanian and international private sector,  other  donors,  and  Jordanian  civil  society,  ERA  TO  1  will  (1)  advance  economic  reforms,  (2) strengthen the business enabling environment, (3) increase exports and local, regional, and international investments, and (4) respond to emerging priorities.

The overall objective of ERA is to accelerate Jordan's sustainable growth, led by increased exports and investment and through a strong, stable business enabling environment by strengthening the capacity of the Government of Jordan (GoJ), targeted institutions, competitiveness of anchor firms and the private sector.

## II.2. Scope of Work

ERA provided tailored technical assistance to Anabtawi Sweets Company by supporting the customization and full deployment  of the Odoo Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system across multiple  modules, including sales, inventory, manufacturing, e-commerce, and accounting. This support was designed to align with the company's growth vision and operational needs. As a result, Anabtawi enhanced its data tracking, decision-making, and process efficiency which resulted in reducing production waste, improving client and cash flow management, enabling a new digital sales channel, and achieving better overall performance.

A detailed case study is required to document this intervention and communicate the success and lessons learned from this collaboration. The case study will serve the following purposes:

1. Knowledge Capture and Documentation: Provide a comprehensive, structured documentation of the ERP  technical assistance process, detailing the phases of system customization, implementation, training, and data migration. Clearly outline what support was provided, how it was  executed,  and  the  resulting  improvements  in  Anabtawi  Sweets'  operational  processes  and digital infrastructure.
2. Performance and Outcome Analysis: Rigorously analyze both qualitative and quantitative data reflecting  the  company's  performance  before  and  after  ERP  implementation.  This  includes identifying measurable  changes  in  production  efficiency,  order  fulfillment  time,  inventory accuracy, reporting capabilities, and staff adoption of digital systems.
3. Communications and Visibility: Gather content that will be utilized for a dynamic and accessible communications  product  (factsheet/booklet)  that  narrates  the  digital  transformation  journey  of Anabtawi Sweets, visualizes key performance improvements, and clearly communicates ERA's role  and  value  in  enhancing operational agility, internal coordination, and data-driven  decisionmaking.

## Annex 2 Guide to Creating a Financial Proposal for a Fixed Price Subcontract

The purpose of this annex is to guide  offerors in creating a budget for their cost proposal. Because the subcontract  will  be  funded  under  a  United  States  government-funded  project,  it  is  important  that  all offerors' budgets conform to this standard format. It is thus strongly recommended that offerors follow the steps described below.

Under  no  circumstances  may  cost  information  be  included  in  the  technical  proposal .  No  cost information or any prices, whether for deliverables or line items, may be included in the technical proposal. Cost information must only be shown in the cost proposal.

Step 1: Design the technical proposal. Offerors should examine the market for the proposed activity and realistically assess how they can meet the needs as described in this RFP, specifically in section II. Offerors should present and describe this assessment in their technical proposals.

Step 2: Determine the basic costs associated with each deliverable. Offerors should consider best estimate of the costs associated with each deliverable, which should include labor and all non-labor costs, e.g. other direct costs, such as fringe, allowances, travel and transport, etc.

Step 3: Create a budget for the cost proposal. Each offeror must create a budget using a spreadsheet program compatible with MS Excel. The budget period should follow the technical proposal period. A sample budget is shown on the following page. All items and services must be clearly labeled and include the total offered price.  The detailed budget must show major line items, including, for example:

1. Salaries
2. Indirect costs
3. Any other costs applicable to the work
4. DBA - see clause I. 11

All cost information must be expressed in Jordanian dinar (JOD).

Step 4: Write Budget Narrative. The spreadsheets shall be accompanied by written notes in MS Word that explain each cost line item and the assumption why a cost is being budgeted as well as how the amount is reasonable. Supporting information must be provided in sufficient detail to allow for a complete analysis of each cost element or line item. Chemonics reserves the right to request additional cost information if the evaluation committee has concerns of the reasonableness, realism, or completeness of an offeror's proposed cost.

If it is an offeror's regular practice to budget indirect rates, e.g. overhead, fringe, G&amp;A, administrative, or other  rate,  Offerors  must  explain  the  rates  and  the  rates'  base  of  application  in  the  budget  narrative. Chemonics reserves the right to request additional information to substantiate an Offeror's indirect rates.

## Sample Budget

Offerors should revise the budget line items accordingly in response to the technical and cost requirements of this RFP.

## Annex 4

## What is an UEI Number?

The Unique Entity Identifier, or the UEI, is the official name of the 'new, non-proprietary identifier' that will replace the DUNS number. The UEI will be requested in, and assigned by, the System for Award Management (SAM.gov). Businesses and organizations who receive funding from the US government will have to use a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) created in SAM.gov. The UEI number helps the USG to identify companies.

## Why am I being requested to obtain a UEI number?

U.S. law - in particular the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Pub.L. 109282), as amended by section 6202 of the Government Funding Transparency Act of 2008 (Pub.L. 110252) - make it a requirement for all entities doing business with the U.S. Government to be registered, currently through the System for Award Management, a single, free, publicly- searchable website that includes information on each federal award. As part of this reporting requirement, prime contractors such as Chemonics must report information on qualifying subawards as outlined in FAR 52.204-10 and 2CFR Part 170. Chemonics is required to report subcontracts with an award valued at greater than or equal to $30,000 under a prime contract and subawards under prime grants or prime cooperative agreements obligating funds of $25,000 or more, whether U.S. or locally based. Because the U.S. Government uses UEI numbers to uniquely identify businesses and organizations, Chemonics is required to enter subaward data with a corresponding UEI number.

## Is there a charge for obtaining a UEI number?

No. Obtaining a UEI number is absolutely free for all entities doing business with the Federal government. This includes current and prospective contractors, grantees, and loan recipients.

## How do I obtain a UEI number?

UEI numbers can be obtained online at SAM.gov.

## What information will I need to obtain a UEI number?

To request a UEI number, you will need to provide the following information:

-  Legal name and structure
-  Tradestyle, Doing Business As (DBA), or other name by which your organization is commonly recognized
-  Physical address, city, state and Zip Code
-  Mailing address (if separate)
-  Telephone number
-  Contact name
-  Number of employees at your location
-  Description of operations and associated code (SIC code found at https://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/sicsearch.html)
-  Annual sales and revenue information
-  Headquarters name and address (if there is a reporting relationship to a parent corporate entity)

## UEI and SAM Registration Guidance

## How long does it take to obtain a UEI number?

The UEI number is issued immediately upon completion of the request process.

## Are there exemptions to the UEI number requirement?

There may be exemptions under specific prime contracts, based on an organization's previous fiscal year income when selected for a subcontract award, or Chemonics may agree that registration is impractical in certain situations. Organizations may discuss these options with the Chemonics representative.

## What is CCR/SAM?

Central Contractor Registration (CCR)-which collected, validated, stored and disseminated data in support of agency acquisition and award missions-was consolidated with other federal systems into the System for Award Management (SAM).

## What benefits do I receive from registering in SAM?

By registering in SAM, you gain the ability to bid on federal government contracts. Your registration does not guarantee your winning a government contract or increasing your level of business. Registration is simply a prerequisite before bidding on a contract. SAM also provides a central storage location for the registrant to supply its information, rather than with each federal agency or prime contractor separately. When information about your business changes, you only need to document the change in one place for every federal government agency to have the most up-to-date information.
